## Drawings
For drawings (e.g. in readme-files), we recomment to use the program [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). It is open source software and runs on Linux, Mac and Windows. If you want to draw electirc circuits, we recommend this library on [github](https://github.com/upb-lea/Inkscape_electric_Symbols).
