==============================
 FEM Magnetics Toolbox (FEMMT)
==============================

Python toolbox to generate preconfigured figures for FEM simulation tools in power electronics

Functionality examples:

     * Work with pre-defined standard core structures [not implemented yet]
     * Use python to perform parametersweeps, e.g. perform several automated simultations of different air gap sizes
     * Read the results automated with python from the FEM simulation tool
