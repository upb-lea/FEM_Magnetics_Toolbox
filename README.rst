FEM Magnetics Toolbox (FEMMT)
=============================

This README only provides a short overview. For more information please have a look at the detailed documentation `here <https://upb-lea.github.io/FEM_Magnetics_Toolbox/intro.html>`__.

Python toolbox to generate preconfigured figures for FEM simulation tools in power electronics.

The toolbox is accessible via python code or a graphical user interface
(GUI), which current development status is experimental.

All core shapes are simulated as 2D symmetric cores, as shown in the figure.

Documentation
-------------------
Please have a look at the `documentation <https://upb-lea.github.io/FEM_Magnetics_Toolbox/intro.html>`__. You will find tutorials and a function description.

Literature
-------------------

* `An Open-Source FEM Magnetics Toolbox for Power Electronic Magnetic Components <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9862128>`__

Installation
---------------

To run FEMMT python (version 3.10 or above) and onelab is needed.

ONELAB installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Go to https://onelab.info/
-  Download the Desktop Version for your OS (Windows, Linux or macOS)
-  Unpack the software and remember the file path. This will be needed
   later when installing FEMMT.

Further steps for macOS(ARM)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Go to https://onelab.info/
-  Download the Desktop Version for Windows
-  Copy the "conveks.py" and "Onelab.py" files and paste them into the "onelab" folder
-  Go to http://getdp.info/
-  Download the macOS(ARM) Version
-  Open the downloaded folder, navigate to "bin" and copy the "getdp" application file
-  Paste the copied file into your "onelab" folder

Install FEMMT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FEMMT can be installed using the python pip package manager.
This is the stable release version (recommended).

::

   pip install femmt

For working with the latest version, refer to the `documentation <https://upb-lea.github.io/FEM_Magnetics_Toolbox/intro.html>`__.

Minimal example
------------------

This toolbox is able to build a complete FEM simulation from simple
Python code. The following figure shows the Python code on the left and
the corresponding FEM simulation on the right. |FEMMT_Screenshot|

To run a minimal example please have a look at the `examples <https://github.com/upb-lea/FEM_Magnetics_Toolbox/tree/main/femmt/examples>`__.

GUI (Experimental)
-------------------

There is a first preview for a GUI. Installing this is a bit cumbersome
at first, but will be simplified in the future:

* Download the complete repository via ``Code`` -> ``Download ZIP`` and unpack it.
* Or clone the repository
* Install the development version of femmt using ``pip install -e .``
* Run python ``.../path-to_femmt/femmt/gui/femmt_gui.py``

Please note, the GUI is experimental.

Troubleshooting
-------------------
If the working directory is within OneDrive, there are problems writing .dat files, which are basic for FEMMT. The following error messages appear:

::

    The system cannot find the file specified: your_directory/femmt/electro_magnetic/Strands_Coefficients/coeff/pB_RS_la0.6_4layer.dat
    FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: your_directory/results/values/j2F_1.dat



The solution is to place the working directory of FEMMT including the Python virtual environment outside the OneDrive folder.

History and project status
------------------------------

This project was initially written in matlab using FEMM simulation tool.
It became clear that the project was no longer a small project. The
project should be completely rewritten, because many new complex levels
have been added. To place the project in the open source world, the
programming language python is used.
